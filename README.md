# The Grad List

Setting it up
-------------
You should follow these instructions in order to get it up and running.

Start by getting Ruby 2 and Rails 4 and then run:

    git clone git@github.com:jeKnowledge/the-grad-list.git
    cd the-grad-list/
    bundle install
    rake db:migrate
    rails server

Finally you can try it out on `localhost:3000` to test the app.
